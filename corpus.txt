The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The sky is blue and the sun is shining.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
Actions speak louder than words.
Birds of a feather flock together.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Fortune favors the bold.
The early bird catches the worm.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Better late than never.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Honesty is the best policy.
Two heads are better than one.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
It takes two to tango.
A watched pot never boils.
Actions speak louder than words.
Curiosity killed the cat.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Practice makes perfect.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
All that glitters is not gold.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Haste makes waste.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Make hay while the sun shines.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Barking up the wrong tree.
Burning the midnight oil.
Cutting corners.
Hitting the nail on the head.
Killing two birds with one stone.
Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
Raining cats and dogs.
Running like the wind.
Take it with a grain of salt.
The ball is in your court.
Time is money.
Under the weather.
Water under the bridge.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Hello, World!
